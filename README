kacTalk_PHP
===========
          
PHP library for kacTalk

Disclaimer
----------

This library (and the whole kacTalk suite) is still in development.

Right now the project contains a mix of new and (very)) old code, some of which is adopted from other languages!

The PHP library is in need of some mayor rewrites (especially of the main class)
to make it include all functionality etc (like scripting).
  
Features
--------

The idea behind kacTalk is to simplify API access.
kacTalk is designed with ideas like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and KISS.

kacTalk is all about generalizing the usage of APIs and general communication
between server and client.  

Paired with the API is a scripting language.
